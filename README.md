# hello-world
TheWorldOfCode
My name is Coder.
I am learning to code on https://FreeCodeCamp.org/, GrassHopper App and SoloLearn App.
I've started to learn in 2015 on codecacademy where I've completed Learn Java and Learn SQL courses.
After that I've tried to find more advanced learning resources online but the only free that was available online was https://flatironschool.com/ and at that time they wanted to do tons of work plus their framework seemed extreamly complicated for me and for those reasons I've started looking for more general information about software development career and found out a lot of information about outsourcing and I was demotivated about all of that at that time and started to focus more on my present self-emloyment.
Only on in December 2019 I've talked to a guy in Sacramento, CA who was learning JS at the moment and told me about employment opportunities in Bay Area and since then I've started to learn again and I found out that there's more free resources now than there were in 2015.
So, it's have been about almost 4 month since I've stated again and I like to code but at the same time I'm not too motivated to get a job in this field and I'm not applying for any but I would consider an offer in case if I would receive good one from any company.
